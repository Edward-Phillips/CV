## Edward Phillips

An Aerospace engineer turned accountant turned developer, coming from a background in online healthcare. Having recently completed the Makers Academy 12 week course I'm eager to start working on a project which makes people's lives easier and lets me demonstrate the value I can bring to the team.

# Skills

### Quick Learner
I earned a promotion to the Finance department after working in Customer Support by learning the accounting software (sage 50/200) in my own time and mastering excel. 
During my time in the Finance team I built file conversion templates in excel to allow our payments to be imported into our banking system directly from our accounting system, which turned a weekly task that took a day for 3 team members to complete to an hour of work for one person. At Makers I learned how to use the MERN stack for the first time in my final project, [WhatStack](#projects), a realtime messaging platform for developers.

### User-Centric Problem Solver
Spending a year working in Customer Support, allowed me to develop my communication skills by having to discuss sensitive medical conditions with patients, and forced me to develop the empathy necessary to consider problems from different perspectives, this ensured I solved the problem that had caused the patient to get in touch, not just the one that I'd been able to identify.

### Team Player
While working in a startup I frequently took on other work from across the company, ranging from: building customer growth models for the marketing team; optimizing the packaging process for the in-house pharmacy; and structuring spreadsheets so that google form responses were displayed in a meaningful to the user whilst also restricting permissions for compliance reasons. E.g. preventing the end user from viewing the raw data.

## Experience

### **Zavamed** (Feb 2017 to Jan 2020)    

*Customer Support Advisor*  (Feb'17 to Jun'17)
- working in customer support really grew my communication skills while working under pressure, at times I would be liaising with a doctor, 4-5 different pharmacies and the patient in the space of as little as 10 minutes in order to secure emergency medication for the patient.

*Senior Customer Support Advisor* (Jun'17 to Mar'18)
- A new role was created to recognise the expertise I had developed in customer communication and problem resolution, this lead to me becoming responsible for the onboarding training of new team members.

*Accounts Assistant* (Mar'18 to Jan'20)
- Working in the finance team allowed me to understand how the company functioned and also taught me the importance of OKRs as I became responsible for planning and tracking the finance teams OKRs for more than a year and a half, from this I recognised the value that having a metric delivers and how important it is to connect the work you do on a day to day basis not only to your team goals but also the wider goals and mission of the company.

### **Brewhouse Bar and Kitchen** (Dec'16 to feb'17)   
*Front of house staff*  
- Working in hospitality was a great opportunity to work on my communication skills, always doing my best to ensure that the clientele were satisfied with the service that they were experiencing and working to resolve any issues that might come up

# Hobbies
I am an origami enthusiast, inspired largely by the work of Eric Joisel. I mainly produce small masks.
I'm also an avid fan of science fiction, particularly the works of Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut.
I can also solve a 3x3 rubik's cube reasonably quickly (average under 2 minutes)
