## Edward Phillips

I'm a former accountant turned developer, coming from a background in online healthcare following a degree in aerospace engineering. I'm eager to start working in a role where I can cut my teeth in a team which will test and grow my skills as a developer.

# Skills

## Quick Learner
I managed to earn a lateral promotion to the finance department after working in customer support by learning the accounting software (sage 50/200) in my own time and learning excel. 
Later I built file conversion templates to allow our payments to be imported into our banking system directly from our accounting system. At Makers I learned how to use the MERN stack for the first time in my final project, a realtime messaging platform.

### People Person
Spending a year working in Customer Support allowed me to develop my communication skills by having to discuss sensitive medical conditions with patients and forced me to consider problems from different perspectives, to ensure I'm solving the problem the patient's calling about, not just the one that I'd found.

### Enthusiastic Worker
While working in a start up in the Customer Support department I frequently took on other pieces of work from across the company, from working with the pharmacy to fold boxes to mail out medication in (ultimately leading to a faster box-folding process being implemented) to working with members in the marketing/growth teams on a variety of problems, from building customer growth models to structuring spreadsheets so that google form responses were displayed in a meaningful way while preventing the viewer from seeing the raw form responses.

# Hobbies
I am an origami enthusiast, inspired largely by the work of Eric Joisel I mainly produce small masks.
I'm also an avid fan of science fiction, particularly the works of Philip k. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut.
I can also solve a 3x3 rubik's cube reasonably quickly (under 2 minutes, more than 1).
