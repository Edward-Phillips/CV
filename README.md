## Edward Phillips

An aerospace engineer graduate turned accounts payable turned developer, coming from a background in online healthcare on an international platform. Having recently completed the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) 12 week developer bootcamp, I'm eager to work in a team where I can support and learn from more senior developers. Following my time in accountancy I would relish the opportunity to work on a product that improves the quality of life for all accountants struggling to close the books each month.

# Review

Want to see how I approach a problem? The table below has links to recorded programming sessions where I go in blind, talk to a 'client' to determine what the specifications of the program they want and test drive a solution to meet those specifications.

# Skills


### Quick Learner
I earned a promotion to the Finance department after working in Customer Support by learning the accounting software (sage 50/200) in my own time and mastering excel. 
During my time in the Finance team I built file conversion templates in excel to allow our payments to be imported into our banking system directly from our accounting system, which turned a weekly task that took a day for 3 team members to complete to an hour of work for one person. At Makers I learned the value in choosing the right tools for the job, from appreciating the power of the basics in building a [news summary dashboard](#projects) using just simple HTML, CSS and Javascript, to how to use the MERN stack for the first time in my final project, [WhatStack](#projects), a realtime messaging platform for developers.

### User-Centric Problem Solver
Spending a year working in Customer Support allowed me to develop my communication skills by discussing sensitive medical conditions with patients, and led me to develop the empathy necessary to consider problems from different perspectives, not just that of the patient but also the doctor and the pharmacist. This ensured I solved the right problem the right way, not necessarily just the initial issue the patient had contacted us about.

### Team Player
While working in a startup I frequently took on other work from across the company, ranging from: building customer growth models for the marketing team; optimizing the packaging process for the in-house pharmacy; and structuring spreadsheets so that google form responses were displayed meaningfully to the user whilst also restricting permissions for compliance reasons [e.g. preventing the end user from viewing the raw data]. Being a natural, empathetic team player also made embedding financial controls and safeguards easier, as I was able to take into account differing objectives and perspectives across teams when creating and implementing solutions.

## Experience

### **Zavamed** (Feb 2017 to Jan 2020)    
*Accounts Assistant* (Mar 2018 to Jan 2020)
- Working in the finance team allowed me to understand how the company's overarching aims were applied in practice and also taught me the importance of OKRs as I became responsible for planning and tracking the finance teams OKRs for more than a year and a half. From this I recognised the value that having a metric delivers and how important it is to connect the work you do on a day to day basis not only to your team goals but also the wider goals and mission of the company.

*Senior Customer Support Advisor* (Jun 2017 to Mar 2018)
- A new role was created for me to recognise the expertise I had developed in customer communication and problem resolution, this lead to me becoming responsible for handling escalated disputes, the onboarding training of new team members and mentoring and supporting a team of seven.

*Customer Support Advisor*  (Feb 2017 to Jun 2017)
- Working in customer support really grew my communication skills while working under pressure. At times I would be liaising with a doctor, 4-5 different pharmacies and the patient in the space of as little as 10 minutes in order to secure emergency medication for the patient.

### **Brewhouse Bar and Kitchen** (Dec 2016 to Feb 2017)   
*Front of house staff*  
- Working in hospitality was a great opportunity to work on my communication skills. I prided myself on always doing my best to ensure that the clientele were satisfied with the service that they were experiencing and working to resolve any issues that may arise.

# Hobbies
I am an origami enthusiast, inspired largely by the work of Eric Joisel.
I'm also an avid fan of science fiction, particularly the works of Philip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut.
I can solve a 3x3 rubik's cube reasonably quickly (average under 2 minutes).
