## Edward Phillips

I'm a junior developer currently studying at the Maker's Academy. After studying Aerospace engineering I spent 3 years working for a medtech startup, 1 year in customer support and 2 in the finance department. 
I am looking for a role where I can cut my teeth on a project which will test and grow my new skills as a developer.


## Quick Learner

I managed to earn a lateral promotion to the finance department after working in customer support by learning the accounting software (sage 50/200) in my own time and learning excel. 
Later I built file conversion templates to allow our payments to be imported into our banking system directly from our accounting system.

### People Person
Spending a year working in Customer Support allowed me to develop my communication skills by having to discuss sensitive medical conditions with patients and forced me to consider problems from different perspectives, to ensure I'm solving the problem the patient's calling about, not just the one that I'd found.

### Process Builder

When working in Customer Support I became responsible for writing out process charts and SOPs for the different situations that could typically arise in a call. 
I joined the finance department following the departure of our management accountant with little experience and the expectation to close the books each month in 2 weeks. I built a gantt chart that tracked the dependencies of tasks and gave clear feedback in which areas where taking longer than expected. The end result was a process that took 3 working days les to close the accounts.
